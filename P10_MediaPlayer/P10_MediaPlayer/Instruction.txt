P10 MediaPlayer project 

This is phase I of MediaPlayer project 
This software currently being built and required to have ArtistTracker functionality
There are 3 class files under artistinfo Artist.java , ArtistTracker.java and App Runner

Each class has description in the file on the top
Start from Artist.java , then go to ArtistsTracker 
you can test your methods locally on AppRunner class with main method

Eventually run junit test ArtistTrackerTest.java to see result before uploading to webcat 

We have done this a showed solution in class , however this is a good time to review 
and pass the test to practice more !!!

Good Luck!
